# 📦 IOT-BASED-SMART-PARCEL-LOCKER-WITH-ONE-TIME-PASSWORD-AND-ALARM-SYSTEM-FOR-SECURITY

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project introduces an **IoT-based smart parcel locker** designed to enhance the security and efficiency of online deliveries. It utilizes **one-time password (OTP)** authentication and an **alarm system** to solve issues such as missed deliveries or package theft. Built using an **ESP32 microcontroller**, the system provides real-time notifications and access control via a mobile app.

## 🎯 Objectives of the Study
- Design a smart parcel locker that secures packages within specific dimensions.
- Develop a software application to notify users upon delivery.
- Implement OTP-based authentication with an alarm system.
- Evaluate the system’s effectiveness in practical use.

## 💼 Business Needs
This system meets essential needs for:
- Secure, unattended parcel deliveries.
- Real-time delivery and access notifications.
- Improved convenience for customers and delivery personnel.
- Reduced risk of theft and missed deliveries.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

### 📟 Hardware & Software
- **ESP32 Microcontroller** – Controls authentication and alarm functions.
- **Google Sheets Web Server Script** – Stores and manages delivery data.
- **App Block Diagram** – Visual representation of application logic.
